# Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) Vehicles vs Electric Vehicles (EVs)

This project was focused on the data exploration and cleanup process of data related to ICE and EVs. Pandas was used to clean and format a number of datasets. And the analysis process itself was accompanied by Jupyter notebooks along with visualizations of the data using Matplotlib. A summary presentation with key questions and conclusions was also produced.

## Project Description

Analyzing the pros/cons of owning an EV vs an ICE vehicle

## Research Questions to be Answered

- What is the current trend in vehicle registrations?
- What is the carbon footprint of ICE vs EVs?
- Which fuel type is more cost-efficient?
- What are the key considerations for charging an EV?

## Conclusions

- What is the current trend in vehicle registrations?
EV, plug-in hybrid electric (PHEV), and hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) registrations have increased about 20-25% year-over-year in the last three years and risen overall by 52% from 2020 through 2022. HEVs continue to make up the majority of electric vehicles registered. However, fully electric vehicle registrations more than doubled from 2020 to 2022.

- What is the carbon footprint of ICE vs EVs?
There are many factors to be considered when determining the total life cycle GHG emissions of an EV, PHEV, or HEV. Although those vehicles produce zero tailpipe GHG emissions when running on 100% electricity, the source of electricity used to charge the vehicle - as well as all the aspects of production of the vehicle - should be considered. Overall, gasoline-powered vehicles produce less emissions than EVs during initial production but more emissions during the overall life cycle of the vehicle.

- Which fuel type is more cost-efficient?
Prices shown over the years for electricity as fuel have been steady, but gas prices are not as consistent given that the price of gas can always fluctuate. Even with the gallon-equivalent of electricity being higher than gas, electricity is still less expensive overall because the amount of electricity needed for EV is less than gallons of gas needed for ICE vehicles.

- What are the key considerations for charging an EV?
    When deciding on an electric vehicle, considerations to include should be:
  - What is the driving range of thevehicle when fully charged?
  - How many charging stations are available in my city and state?
Both considerations will be important for daily driving needs as well as planning trips by car.

Most of the top 20 vehicles in terms of driving range are in excess of 300 miles. Tesla has the most models with high driving ranges - 4 in the top 10 (330 to 405 miles).

Availability of charging stations abounds in California. After California,a few states have more than 2,000 stations per state. Most other states are below 2,000 stations. Tesla stations account for only a fraction of total state stations.

Most cities across the US have fewer than 500 charging stations. And with the exception of New York, Tesla has 50 or fewer stations per city.

## SUMMARY / FINAL CONCLUSION

- ICE vehicles produce almost five times more GHG emissions annually than fully electric vehicles.
- Electric vehicles have a cheaper fuel cost nationally, resulting in a cheaper way to travel from place to place.
- Vehicle driving range and charging station availability will be important considerations in decision-making about an electric vehicle.
