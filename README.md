# Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) Vehicles vs Electric Vehicles (EVs)

This project was focused on the data exploration and cleanup process of data related to ICE and EVs. Pandas was used to clean and format a number of datasets. And the analysis process itself was accompanied by Jupyter notebooks along with visualizations of the data using Matplotlib. A summary presentation with key questions and conclusions was also produced.

## Project Description

Analyzing the pros/cons of owning an EV vs an ICE vehicle

## Research Questions to be Answered

- What is the carbon footprint of ICE vs EVs?
- What is the operating & maintenance cost comparison over 5 years for an EV/ICE Vehicle? (This information is not addressed due to missing a team member for presentation)
- Which fuel type is more cost-efficient?
- What are the key considerations for charging an EV?
